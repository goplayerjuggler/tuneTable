# Tune table
An HTML viewer for lists of tunes. It uses data in a hybrid format where the tune can be given in [ABC format](https://abcnotation.com) or more simply just with some metadata. 

Features: 
* a popup score viewer with transpose buttons, for tunes where the abc is included
* sorting and filtering of the list of tunes
* incipits for tunes
* can add links to audio references to the tunes along with notes
* tunes can have multiple settings in ABC
* other lists of tunes in ABC format can be imported

## Current list of tunes
It’s a hodgepodge list of tunes I either like, am interested in, or want to share with some musicians, or … 
A fair number of the scores there are my own work, either transcriptions of other people’s tunes or original pieces. I reserve some rights on this via a CC licence; details below.

It should be possible to adapt the tool so as to use other lists of tunes – maybe this tool could be useful more widely?

## Live demo
Live demo here: [goplayerjuggler.github.io/tuneTable](https://goplayerjuggler.github.io/tuneTable/).

### Parameters `n` (name) and `q` (query)
* You can open a specific tune directly by specifying part of its name, eg: 
[goplayerjuggler.github.io/tuneTable/?n=cameronian](https://goplayerjuggler.github.io/tuneTable/?n=cameronian) 
* query everything that matches with `q` in the URL:
[goplayerjuggler.github.io/tuneTable/?q=hop](https://goplayerjuggler.github.io/tuneTable/?q=hop)

## Dev notes
Most of the code was generated by Claude.ai. Tune rendering and transposing is done by [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs), a library written by by Paul Rosen and Gregory Dyke.

A tip of the hat Michael Eskin’s amazing and indispensable online ABC editor, [ABC tools](https://michaeleskin.com/app/abctools.html), which no doubt is part of the inspiration behind this. Michael has already kindly given me a few tips on several details.
