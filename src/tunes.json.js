N:0. I find the overall rhythmic structure fascinating: (3+4)+(3+4)+(4+3+4) (=25). 
N:Beautiful; it just simply works! I think you could call this a crooked tune.
N:1. There are full details about the recording this is based on at the two following links:
N:a. https://itmacatalogues.ie/Portal/Default/en-GB/RecordView/Index/47670
N:b. https://www.itma.ie/playlists/josephine-keegan/
N:Anyway the recording is highly recommended, with lovely instrumentals by:
N:McKenna, Seán Óg, banjo; Gairbhí, Ide, concertina; Dunne, Brian, guitar
N:All the above information is from itma.ie.
N:2. The lyrics are very close to those given here:
N: http://www.celticlyricscorner.net/domhnaill/spanish.htm
N:It seems to be more or less based on the version on the album 
N: Idir an Dá Sholas (1999) by Maighread Ní Dhomhnaill, Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill and Dónal Lunny.
N:3. There’s a lot of other information about this song and its variants here:
N:https://mainlynorfolk.info/nic.jones/songs/thespanishlady.html
N:4. Interesting things are happening for the chord/harmony backing in bar number 6. 
N:There’s a sort of walking bass feel going 
N:downwards stepwise: D C B A. I’m not 100% sure about the chords I put down there; 
N:there may well be good alternatives.
N:5. I decided not to attempt to give any rhythmic details for how
N:the song was actually sung. There’s an enormous amount of rhythmical variation in there, 
N:sometimes it’s ahead of the beat, sometimes not… I think a precise transcription would 
N:be fearsomely complicated and far beyond anything I can reasonably attempt.
N:6. Here are the rest of the lyrics: 
N:Well I stopped to look but the watchman passed
N:Says he, “Young fella, now the hour is late
N:And off wit’ you now or I will wrestle you
N:Straight to the Bridewell gate”
N:But I got a look from the Spanish lady
N:Hot as a fire of amb’ry coal
N:And in all me life I ne’er did see
N:A maid so neat about the sole
N:(Chorus)
N:As I was walking through Dublin City
N:As the dawn of day was o’er
N:Well who should we see but the Spanish lady
N:When I was weary and footsore
N:But she had a heart so full of loving
N:And all her love she longed to share
N:And in all me life I ne’er did see
N:A maid who had so much to spare
N:(Chorus)
N:Well I’ve wandered north and I’ve wandered south
N:By Stoneybatter and Patrick’s Close
N:And up around by the Gloucester Diamond
N:Back by Sally Napper Tandy’s house
N:But old age put her hand upon me
N:Cold as a fire of ashey coals
N:And gone is the lovely Spanish lady
N:Neat and sweet about the soles
N:(Chorus)
N:Well around and around goes the wheel of fortune
N:And where it goes it wearies me
N:Oh fair young maids are so deceiving
N:Sad experience teaches me
N:(Chorus)
N:7. I did a little research and it seems Bridewell Gate, Stoneybatter, 
N:Patrick’s Close and the Gloucester Diamond are places in Dublin. No idea
N:about Sally Napper Tandy’s house though.
